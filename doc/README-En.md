A plugin for batch and manual modification of Zotero item data, helping users efficiently organize bibliographic metadata.

This plugin aims to support users in performing batch manual modifications of Zotero item data to improve the efficiency of bibliographic metadata organization.

The plugin was initially developed to address limitations of automatic repair functions and to implement custom normalization features. It is recommended to first use the Linter plugin [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/northword/zotero-format-metadata?label=zotero-format-metadata&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/northword/zotero-format-metadata) for automatic item normalization, which can resolve most item standardization issues. However, special cases still exist, such as all authors being on the same line or reversed author name order. In such cases, users can make manual adjustments through this plugin. If the modification process is complex, users can also directly input all author information for the literature to quickly achieve normalization of author names and their order.

Additionally, this plugin supports users in customizing the display format of author names (single-field or dual-field) according to personal preferences, better adapting to different users' reading habits.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Author Field Disorder Correction

Handles chaotic author name formatting issues with support for multiple operation modes:

- **1.1 Author Name Splitting and Merging**
  - Choose different processing methods based on literature language (Chinese/English)
  - Dual-field mode: Last name first, first name last
  - Single-field mode:
    - Chinese: Maintains last name first, first name last with no spaces between names, conforming to reading habits
    - English: Maintains first name first, last name last, conforming to reading habits

- **1.2 Swap Author Names**
  - Suitable for cases where author last and first names are reversed
  - Recommended for use in dual-field mode
  - Single-field mode uses the first space to separate last and first names by default; Chinese names automatically recognize common surnames for name separation
