A plugin for batch and manual modification of Zotero item data, helping users efficiently organize bibliographic metadata.

This plugin aims to support users in performing batch manual modifications of Zotero item data to improve the efficiency of bibliographic metadata organization.

The plugin was initially developed to address limitations of automatic repair functions and to implement custom normalization features. It is recommended to first use the Linter plugin [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/northword/zotero-format-metadata?label=zotero-format-metadata&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/northword/zotero-format-metadata) for automatic item normalization, which can resolve most item standardization issues.If certain special cases persist after automatic repair‚Äîsuch as all authors being listed on the same line or reversed author name order‚Äîusers can manually adjust them using this plugin. If modifying author names proves too complex, users may also directly input the complete author information of the reference to quickly standardize author names and their order.

Additionally, this plugin supports users in customizing the display format of author names (single-field or dual-field) according to personal preferences, better adapting to different users' reading habits.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Author Field Disorder Correction

Handles chaotic author name formatting issues with support for multiple operation modes:

- **1.1 Author Name Splitting and Merging**
  - Choose different processing methods based on literature language (Chinese/English)
  - Dual-field mode: Last name first, first name last
  - Single-field mode:
    - Chinese: Maintains last name first, first name last with no spaces between names, conforming to reading habits
    - English: Maintains first name first, last name last, conforming to reading habits

- **1.2 Swap Author Names**
  - Suitable for cases where author last and first names are reversed
  - Recommended for use in dual-field mode
  - Single-field mode uses the first space to separate last and first names by default; Chinese names automatically recognize common surnames for name separation

- **1.3 Batch Modification of Authors on Same Line**
  - Automatically recognizes and splits when all authors are on the same line
  - Requires selection of separator between authors on the same line
  - This mode, in the dual-column layout, automatically identifies common surnames in Chinese names to separate the first and last names, while for English names, it uses the last space to distinguish between the first and last names.

- **1.4 Remove Hyphens from Names**

  - Single-field mode uses the last space to separate last and first names by default, with the front part being the first name

- **1.5 Manual Input of Author Information**
  - When item authors are mostly missing or when the above adjustments are inconvenient, all authors can be manually input
  - Options for dual-field or single-field mode, with author input according to page prompts
  - One item only
